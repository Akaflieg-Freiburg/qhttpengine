QHttpEngine provides a simple set of classes for developing HTTP server applications in Qt.

The design goals of QHttpEngine include:

- **Reliability** - extremely exhaustive test suite ensures that bugs are caught as soon as they are introduced
- **Flexibility** - classes are designed for easy integration with existing Qt code
- **Simplicity** - everything is intentionally kept as simple as possible
- **Usability** - documentation is provided for all classes
